## Miscellanous Files Used for Analysis 

This directory stores several files that were either used for early exploratory data analysis, as well as some additional documentation: 

- Four text files in the `dictionary` subdirectory, summarizing the objective and behavorial and model conditions for the each of the four studies in the ds009 data set. Note that we only used the data for the BART study. 
- `BART_Data_Beginning.ipynb`: An iPython notebook with some early exploration of the BART data. It can be rendered into a viewable HTML file by navigating to the `project-alpha/code` directory and calling `make misc`. 
- `Commentary_on_Event_Response_analysis.txt`: A file to document some of the pros and cons of different approaches to convolution. Intended to be shared among group members. 
- `understanding_convolution.txt`: A file to document the motivation and usage of the ``finalized'' convolution method. Intended to be shared among group members.
