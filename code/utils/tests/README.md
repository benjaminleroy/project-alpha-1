## Testing User-Defined Functions

This repository stores the test files for all of the user-defined functions 
used for analysis. The code and explanations for the functions themselves can 
be found in `project-alpha/code/utils/functions`. The file names generally 
indicate the functions or modules being tested. To run the tests, please 
navigate to the `project-alpha/code` directory and call `make test`.
