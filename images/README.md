## Generated Images

This directory is used to store images generated by any of the code scripts in 
the project repository (either from `project-alpha/code/utils/scripts` or `project-alpha/final/scripts`). Images required to generate the report and 
slides are cached here for convenience, but may also be reproduced by the 
user. To reproduce all of the images required for the report and paper, please 
navigate to the `project-alpha/final`directory and run `make all`.
