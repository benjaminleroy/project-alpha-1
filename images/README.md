## Raw `.tex` Files for the Report's Sections

This directory is used to store images generated by any of the code scripts in the project repository (either from `project-alpha/code/utils/scripts` or `project-alpha/final/scripts`). Images required to generate the report and slides are cached here for convenience, but may also be reproduced by the user. Please navigate the the aforementioned script directories for instructions on how to re-generate images.
