This repository stores the documentation of our analysis of the balloon-
analogue risk task (BART) data included as part of the OpenfMRI ds009 data 
set [*The generality of self-control*]
(https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000009/). The original analysis was conducted 
in 2009 by Jessica Cohen for her doctoral thesis at UCLA, and was largely 
focused on comparing different notions of self-control across several fMRI 
studies. Our original aim was to reproduce the original analysis. However, we 
were unable to do so for many of the methods used, either due to the 
utilization of unavailable pre-packaged software or because we could not 
justify the underlying theory for some approaches. So, we chose to develop 
our own pre-processing pipeline and pursue new directions for identifying 
activation regions for the BART study. Our ultimate goal is to compare our 
results with those of Cohen's paper. 

Many thanks to Jarrod Millman, Matthew Brett, J-B Poline, and Ross Barnowski 
for their advice and encouragement. 


## Navigating the Repository 

The Makefile contains recipes to perform all final analysis of the data and 
test all user-defined functions. 

- `make all`: Downloads and validates the data and then performs all final 
analysis. 
- `make clean`: Removes all extra files generated when compiling code. Does 
this recursively for all subdirectories. 
- `make test`: Tests the functions located in the `data` and `code` 
directories, to be used to validate and analyze the data, respectively. 
- `make verbose`: Performs the same actions as `make test`, but uses the 
verbose nosetests option. 
- `make coverage`: Generates a coverage report for the functions located in 
the `data` and `code` directories. 

Additional documentation and information on the subdirectories can be found in 
their respective READMEs. 

- `code`: Code files for all user-defined functions used for analysis. 
- `data`: Data used for our analysis and tests can be downloaded and validated 
here. 
- `final`: Scripts to run the final analysis. The `make all` recipe in the 
present directory essentially runs all the scripts in `final`.
- `images`: Stores all output figures generated by the analysis scripts. 
Figures required for the report and slides are cached for convenience, but may 
also be reproduced. 
- `paper`: Files and instructions to generate the report. 
- `proposal`: Files and instructions to generate the proposal. 
- `slides`: Files and instructions to generate the progress report and final 
slides.
