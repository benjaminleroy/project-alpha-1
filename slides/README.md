## Generating the Slides 

The Makefile contains four commands: `allprogress`, `cleanprogress`, `allfinal`, and `cleanfinal`. 
- `make allprogress`: Generates the PDF of our progress report slides. 
- `make cleanprogress`: Removes the progress report PDF slides. 

- `make allfinal`: Generates the PDF of our final slides. 
- `make cleanfinal`: Removes the final PDF slides. 

Images required to generate the slides are cached in the `images` subdirectory, but may also be re-generated by navigating to the `project-alpha/final` directory and running the appropriate scripts.
