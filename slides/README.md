## Generating the Slides 

The Makefile contains recipes to generate slides. 

- `make progress`: Generates the PDF of our progress report slides.
 
- `make final`: Generates the PDF of our final slides. 

- `make clean`: Removes the progress report and final PDF slides. 

Images required to generate the report are cached in the 
`project-alpha/images`  directory, but may also be reproduced by navigating to 
the `project-alpha/final`directory and running `make all`.
