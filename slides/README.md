## Generating the Slides 

The Makefile contains recipes to generate slides. 

- `make progress`: Generates the PDF of our progress report slides. 
- `make final`: Generates the PDF of our final slides. 

- `make clean`: Removes the proegress report and final PDF slides. 

Images required to generate the report are cached in the `project-alpha/images`  directory, but may also be re-generated by navigating to the `project-alpha/final` and `project-alpha/final/scripts` directories and running the appropriate scripts.
