\par \indent Much of our future work will concern reproducing our analysis 
on the clean version of the data provided by OpenfMRI and comparing those 
results with the results from using our own preprocessing techniques. One 
issue that arises with the addition of the new cleaned data is that the 
dimension sizes of the scans are different, which will create challenges 
for comparing the two data sets. 

\par If we have the time, permutation tests, which have few assumptions and 
are easy to interpret (but computationally intensive), would be a useful 
tool for identifying brain regions with significant activity. Additional 
tests and checks for model assumptions would also be valuable for assessing 
the appropriateness of our existing hypothesis testing.
