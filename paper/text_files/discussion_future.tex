\par \indent We have specified several models for linear regression and 
considered various methods for hypothesis testing across multiple voxels 
and subjects. Now our main objective is to distill all of our work into 
interpretable results that can be used to identify brain regions with 
high neurological activity during the course of the BART events. 

\par Additional future work will concern reproducing our analysis on the 
clean version of the data provided by OpenfMRI and comparing those results 
with the results from using our own preprocessing techniques. One issue 
that arises with the addition of the new cleaned data is that the dimension 
sizes of the scans are different, which will create challenges for 
comparing the two data sets. 

\par If we have the time, permutation tests, which have few assumptions and 
are easy to interpret (but computationally intensive), would be a useful 
tool for identifying brain regions with significant activity. Additional 
tests and checks for model assumptions would also be valuable for assessing 
the appropriateness of our existing hypothesis testing.
