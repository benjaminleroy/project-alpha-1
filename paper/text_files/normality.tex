% tex file for normality
\par \indent Normality tests are null hypothesis tests AGAINST the assumption 
of normality. In our dataset, we first used the Shapiro-Wilk test to conduct a 
normality for our dataset. With a p-value of ______ and less than 0.05, this
signifies that we should reject the null hypothesis that our samples come from
a normal distribution. 

\par Despite the fact that Shapiro-Wilk test works very well if every residual 
is unique, it does not work well when there are identical multiple residuals. 
For that reason, we then tested normality via the Kruskal-Wallis test, which 
allows us to decide if the population distributins are identical without assuming 
them to follow normal distribution.
