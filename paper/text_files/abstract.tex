\par Self-control is an interesting field of behavioral research with broad 
implications for our day-to-day experiences. Being able to appropriately 
regulate and check our impulses and reactions to various everyday stimuli 
is necessary for maintaining health and high-functionality in society. 
Thus, relating a subjectâ€™s ability to control risky behavior to an area 
of the brain or focusing on understanding what connects self control to 
neurological activity has been the focus of many studies. One approach to 
capturint these neurological facets is to use functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI). Our goal is to reproduce and extend the fMRI analysis for a 
Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) study described in \textit{The Development 
and Generality of Self-Control} \cite{CohenSelfControl}.
