% tex file for hypothesis testing results 
\par \indent The results of our simple linear regression t-statistic 
comparisons across subjects are shown in [Figure \ref{fig:ht}]. We can see 
each slice of the brain from top to bottom in each section of the image. The 
blue areas shows parts of the brain that had a negative t-statistic while the 
red parts of the image shows parts of the brain that had a positive t-
statistic.

\par The parts of the image that were cut out by the mask are white so we can 
more clearly see the contrast in our results. Based on a cursory look at this 
image, we can see a pattern of dark red (high positive t-statistics) in the lower 
left parts of the brain, and area of dark blue (high negative t-statistics) in 
the center and lower middle parts parts of the brain.
