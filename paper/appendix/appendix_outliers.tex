% Outliers appendix. 

\par \indent We considered following the procedure implemented as part of 
Homework 2 to detect and remove outlier 3-D volumes from the 4-D image scans
of each subject. The process involves finding the root mean squares (RMS) of 
each 3-D volume across time and then getting the difference values. When a 
given volume is very different from the preceding volume, this may indicate a 
potential outlier or the sign of an artifact. We used thresholds based on 1.5 
$\times$ IQR added to the 75th percentile and subtracted from the 25th 
percentile to create the cutoffs for the RMS difference outliers. We then 
extended the RMS difference outliers by labeling the volumes on either side of 
the outlier RMS difference as being outliers. 

\par Each subject was considered independently, as considerable variation in 
measurement is expected between different subjects. However, we found that 
reductions in mean residual sum of squares from running simple linear 
regression before and after removing the extended RMS difference outliers were 
minimal. Visually speaking, we also did not observe the presence of egregiously
different points. So, we opted to refrain from removing outliers, at least 
through the extended RMS difference method.
