% tex file for normality
\par \indent The validity of our hypothesis tests of the estimated 
$\hat{\beta}$ values from the chosen linear regression model are largely 
dependent on whether we can reasonably assume that the errors in our model 
are independent and identically distributed from some normal distribution 
with mean zero and constant variance. We focus here on checking the normality 
assumption. It is generally wise to use visualizations, such as residual vs. 
fitted values plots and quantile-quantile plots to inspect residuals for 
patterns and abnormalities. However, considering the sheer quantity of data 
we are working with --- each of the 24 subjects has 64 $\times$ 64 $\times$ 34 
voxels that can each in turn be fitted to a model --- visual inspection is 
not practical. 

For this reason, we turned to using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, 
which tests the null hypothesis that the data in question is normally 
distributed. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed for each set of residuals 
corresponding to a single voxel's time course. That is, each test used around 
200 observations, or the number of time points for that particular subject. 
200 observations is not an especially large sample size, and for this reason, 
we express some concern because normality tests have low power for small 
sample sizes. Shapiro-Wilk may incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis 
due to this bias \cite{ghasemi2012normality}. 

The average proportion of Shaprio-Wilk test ``p-values'' above 0.05 was 0.742 
for the unmasked residuals across both subjects and voxels and noticeably 
lower at 0.630 for the masked residuals. However, since using the masked data 
is more theoretically justifiable (the unmasked data contains many voxels 
outside of the brain), we will be using the masked data for our analysis 
anyway, despite the lower proportion of voxels whose residuals meet our 
normality check. Note that these proportions suggest that only about 
two-thirds of the masked voxels have residuals that are approximately normal, 
and that the others deviate significantly from the normal distribution 
(especially when considering our concerns about the power of Shaprio-Wilk 
tests for small sample sizes). So when discussing our models and especially 
when looking at the conclusions made by our hypothesis tests, one should 
exercise caution about the validity of those conjectures. 

Figure \ref{fig:sw} compares the spatial distribution of the Shapiro-Wilk 
``p-values'' for Subject 10's masked and unmasked data. The unmasked figure 
is very difficult to interpret, but the masked figure does suggest that while 
the spatial distribution of voxels with approximately normal residuals is 
reasonably uniform in many regions, there are a few areas that consistently 
have very low ``p-values'' at around or below the 0.05 threshold. Examples of 
these regions for Subject 10 include a small area between the front and center 
of the brain and a few spots near the sides. These observations are not 
consistent across all subjects, however, so much of it may simply be due to 
noise.
