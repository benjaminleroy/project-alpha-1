## Subdirectories to Store Data Generated by Final Analysis 

Each subdirectory stores the data (typically on a per-subject level) output by the final analysis scripts. 

- `betas`: beta coefficient estimates from the linear models. 
- `bh_t_beta`: Averages across subjects of the proportion of significant Benjamini-Hochberg corrected "p-values" and  t-statistics and beta coefficient estimates above certain thresholds. 
- `hrf`: Convolved and time-shifted HRFs. 
- `model_comparison`: AIC, BIC, and adjusted R-squared values from various potential linear models. 
- `p-values`: "p-values" from hypothesis testing for the linear models. 
- `residual`: Residuals from the linear models. 
- `smooth`: Spatially smoothed voxels. 
- `t_stat`: t-statistics corresponding to the beta coefficient estimates from the linear models. 
- `X`: The covariance matrices of the predictors from the linear models.
