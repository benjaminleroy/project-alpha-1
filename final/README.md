## Final Analysis of the Data 

The Makefile contains recipes to perform the final analysis. 

- `make data`: Performs the all final data analysis that generates data files, 
which are saved to the `data` subdirectory. Many large data files are created 
from this command. 
- `make images`: Performs all the final data analysis that generates images, 
which are saved to `project-alpha/images`. This includes all figures required 
for the report and slides. For convenience, images required for the report and 
slides are also cached in this directory. 
- `make all`: Performs all final data analysis, including final supplementary 
data analysis and generating all figures required for the report and slides. 
Many large data files are created from this command. 

- `make clean`: Removes all extra files generated when compiling code. Does 
this recursively for all subdirectories. 

Additional documentation and information on the subdirectories can be found in 
their respective READMEs. 
 
- `data`: Stores all data generated by final analysis. 
- `data_scripts`: Scripts to run all final analysis and supplementary final 
that generate data files. 
- `image_scripts`: Scripts to run all final analysis and supplementary final 
work that generate images.
