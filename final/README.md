## Final Analysis of the Data 

The Makefile contains recipes to perform the final analysis for the project, as well as generate some supplementary work and figures required for the report and slides. 

- `make analysis`: Performs the final data analysis. Does not include the supplementary exploratory data analysis or additional figures generated by `make eda` and `make figs`. 
- `make eda`: Performs supplementary final exploratory data analysis. 
- `make figs`: Runs scripts to reproduce additional figures not generated by `make analysis` or `make eda` that are nevertheless required for the report and slides. 
- `make all`: Performs all final data analysis and supplementary exploratory data analysis. Also reproduces all figures required for the report and slides. 

LIST ALL THE COMMANDS TO RUN THE INDIVIDUAL FILES HERE. 

- `make clean`: Remove all extra files generated when compiling code. Does this recursively for all subdirectories. 

Additional documentation and information on the subdirectories can be found in their respective READMEs. 

- `scripts`: Scripts to run all final analysis and supplementary final work. 
- `data`: Stores all data generated by final analysis. 

All output figures are saved in `project-alpha/images`, which also caches the figures required for the report and slides. These figures can be reproduced in their entirety by running `make all`.
